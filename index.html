          <p>
            Climbing is something we've all done at some point, be it climbing
            the stairs, a nice-looking tree, or the corporate ladder.<br /><br />
            Climbing rocks as an outdoor activity has been a leisure activity
            for centuries, but we're looking at modern styles of climbing and
            some of the hardest forms it has taken so far.

          <h1 class="sectionh1">Traditional Climbing</h1>
          <p>
            Within the traditional climbing discipline, climbers carry
            protective gear on their harness and place it into features of the
            rock to catch them if they fall. These pieces of protection are most
            commonly nuts, hexes, and cams. Nuts and hexes are passive
            protection; static pieces that simply wedge into the rock. Cams are
            a bit fancier, and feature 4 lobes. In their default position, lobes
            are widest. There is a spring-loaded lever which will pull the lobes
            downwards, making them narrower. These are then placed into a crack,
            and the outwards force of the cam keeps it in place in the rock.<br /><br />
            This image is of a climb named The Walk of Life. It was first
            climbed in 2008 by James Pearson, who declared this climb to be the
            hardest trad climb in the world, and gave it the grade E12 (the E
            means extreme). Another climber, Dave MacLeod, climbed this in
            January 2009, and decimated James Person's grade, knocking the
            difficulty down to E9.

          <p>
            Sport climbing is the most accessible form of rope climbing. Holes
            are drilled into a rockface and bolts glued in, to allow carabiners
            to be easily and securely attached.<br /><br />
            This climber is named Adam Ondra, who was the first climber to set a
            grade of 9C. <br /><br />Sport climbing grades are different to
            traditional grades, and boulder grades. His 9C is a route named
            Silence in a gorgeous cave in Flatanger, Norway. It took him several
            years to successfully do this, and he is considered the best climber
            in the world today.

            This boulder a big piece of red granite located in Finland, and the
            route is named Burden of Dreams. It gets the grade V17, and was the
            first of that difficulty, where there are now a handful of V17
            climbs.
